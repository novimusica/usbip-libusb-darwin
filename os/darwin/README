Still debugging.

1. Problems

  1) libusb_claim_interface() fails with LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS(-3)

      OSX doesn't support libusb_detach_kernel_driver().
      It needs to be detached manually if it's hot plugged.

  2) libusb_submit_transfer() fails with LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND(-5)

      For USB storage, it can be claimed after ejected and unloaded
      com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorage.  But the device cannot be seen after
      successfully claimed.
